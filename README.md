Optimized CI/CD script to make it more versatile and easier to maintain. Detailed comments and explanations of each step have been added.

Advantages of This Approach:

1. Maintainability: By using placeholders for paths, you make the script easier to maintain and update without exposing sensitive information or specific server details.

2. Readability: Detailed comments help others understand what each part of the script does, making it easier for new team members to get up to speed.

3. Reusability: By using variables and placeholders, the script can be reused across different environments or projects with minimal changes.

4. Security: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the script. Using environment variables and placeholders promotes better security practices.

5. Modularity: By structuring the script with stages and extending base configurations, you can easily manage complex deployments and ensure consistency across environments.
